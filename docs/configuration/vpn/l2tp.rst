L2TP
----

VyOS utilizes accel-ppp_ to provide L2TP server functionality. It can be used
with local authentication or a connected RADIUS server.

L2TP over IPsec
===============

Example for configuring a simple L2TP over IPsec VPN for remote access (works
with native Windows and Mac VPN clients):

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn ipsec ipsec-interfaces interface eth0
  set vpn ipsec nat-traversal enable
  set vpn ipsec nat-networks allowed-network 0.0.0.0/0

  set vpn l2tp remote-access outside-address 192.0.2.2
  set vpn l2tp remote-access client-ip-pool start 192.168.255.2
  set vpn l2tp remote-access client-ip-pool stop 192.168.255.254
  set vpn l2tp remote-access ipsec-settings authentication mode pre-shared-secret
  set vpn l2tp remote-access ipsec-settings authentication pre-shared-secret <secret>
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication mode local
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication local-users username test password 'test'

In the example above an external IP of 192.0.2.2 is assumed.

If a local firewall policy is in place on your external interface you will need
to allow the ports below:

* UDP port 500 (IKE)
* IP protocol number 50 (ESP)
* UDP port 1701 for IPsec

As well as the below to allow NAT-traversal (when NAT is detected by the
VPN client, ESP is encapsulated in UDP for NAT-traversal):

* UDP port 4500 (NAT-T)

Example:

.. code-block:: none

  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 40 action 'accept'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 40 protocol 'esp'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 41 action 'accept'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 41 destination port '500'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 41 protocol 'udp'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 42 action 'accept'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 42 destination port '4500'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 42 protocol 'udp'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 43 action 'accept'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 43 destination port '1701'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 43 ipsec 'match-ipsec'
  set firewall name OUTSIDE-LOCAL rule 43 protocol 'udp'

To allow VPN-clients access via your external address, a NAT rule is required:


.. code-block:: none

  set nat source rule 110 outbound-interface 'eth0'
  set nat source rule 110 source address '192.168.255.0/24'
  set nat source rule 110 translation address masquerade


VPN-clients will request configuration parameters, optionally you can DNS
parameter to the client.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access dns-servers server-1 '8.8.8.8'
  set vpn l2tp remote-access dns-servers server-2 '8.8.4.4'

.. note:: Those are the `Google public DNS`_ servers, but you can choose
   any public available servers, like Quad9_ (9.9.9.9), Cloudflare_ (1.1.1.1)
   or OpenNIC_.

Established sessions can be viewed using the **show vpn remote-access**
operational command, or **show l2tp-server sessions**

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ show vpn remote-access
   ifname | username | calling-sid  |      ip       | rate-limit | type | comp | state  |  uptime
  --------+----------+--------------+---------------+------------+------+------+--------+----------
   ppp0   | vyos     | 192.168.0.36 | 192.168.255.1 |            | l2tp |      | active | 00:06:13


LNS (L2TP Network Server)
=========================

LNS are often used to connect to a LAC (L2TP Access Concentrator).

Below is an example to configure a LNS:

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access outside-address 192.0.2.2
  set vpn l2tp remote-access client-ip-pool start 192.168.255.2
  set vpn l2tp remote-access client-ip-pool stop 192.168.255.254
  set vpn l2tp remote-access lns shared-secret 'secret'
  set vpn l2tp remote-access ccp-disable
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication mode local
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication local-users username test password 'test'

The example above uses 192.0.2.2 as external IP address. A LAC normally
requires an authentication password, which is set in the example configuration
to ``lns shared-secret 'secret'``. This setup requires the Compression Control
Protocol (CCP) being disabled, the command ``set vpn l2tp remote-access ccp-disable``
accomplishes that.


Bandwidth Shaping
=================

Bandwidth rate limits can be set for local users or via RADIUS based attributes.

Bandwidth Shaping for local users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rate-limit is set in kbit/sec.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access outside-address 192.0.2.2
  set vpn l2tp remote-access client-ip-pool start 192.168.255.2
  set vpn l2tp remote-access client-ip-pool stop 192.168.255.254
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication mode local
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication local-users username test password test
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication local-users username test rate-limit download 20480
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication local-users username test rate-limit upload 10240

  vyos@vyos:~$ show vpn remote-access
  ifname | username | calling-sid  |      ip       | rate-limit  | type | comp | state  |  uptime
  -------+----------+--------------+---------------+-------------+------+------+--------+-----------
  ppp0   | test     | 192.168.0.36 | 192.168.255.2 | 20480/10240 | l2tp |      | active | 00:06:30

RADIUS authentication
======================

To enable RADIUS based authentication, the authentication mode needs to be
changed within the configuration. Previous settings like the local users, still
exists within the configuration, however they are not used if the mode has been
changed from local to radius. Once changed back to local, it will use all local
accounts again.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication mode <local|radius>

Since the RADIUS server would be a single point of failure, multiple RADIUS
servers can be setup and will be used subsequentially.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication radius server 10.0.0.1 key 'foo'
  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication radius server 10.0.0.2 key 'foo'

.. note:: Some RADIUS_ severs use an access control list which allows or denies
   queries, make sure to add your VyOS router to the allowed client list.

RADIUS source address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using OSPF as IGP always the closets interface connected to the RADIUS
server is used. With VyOS 1.2 you can bind all outgoing RADIUS requests to a
single source IP e.g. the loopback interface.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication radius source-address 10.0.0.3

Above command will use `10.0.0.3` as source IPv4 address for all RADIUS queries
on this NAS.

.. note:: The ``source-address`` must be configured on one of VyOS interface.
   Best proctice would be a loopback or dummy interface.

RADIUS bandwidth shaping attribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable bandwidth shaping via RADIUS, the option rate-limit needs to be enabled.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication radius rate-limit enable

The default RADIUS attribute for rate limiting is ``Filter-Id``, but you may also
redefine it.

.. code-block:: none

  set vpn l2tp remote-access authentication radius rate-limit attribute Download-Speed

.. note:: If you set a custom RADIUS attribute you must define it on both
   dictionaries at RADIUS server and client, which is the vyos router in our
   example.

The RADIUS dictionaries in VyOS are located at ``/usr/share/accel-ppp/radius/``

RADIUS advanced features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Received RADIUS attributes have a higher priority than parameters defined within
the CLI configuration, refer to the explanation below.

Allocation clients ip addresses by RADIUS
*****************************************

If the RADIUS server sends the attribute ``Framed-IP-Address`` then this IP
address will be allocated to the client and the option ip-pool within the CLI
config is being ignored.

Renaming clients interfaces by RADIUS
*************************************

If the RADIUS server uses the attribute ``NAS-Port-Id``, ppp tunnels will be
renamed.

.. note:: The value of the attribute ``NAS-Port-Id`` must be less than 16
   characters, otherwise the interface won't be renamed.
