Bridge
######

A Bridge is a way to connect two Ethernet segments together in a
protocol independent way. Packets are forwarded based on Ethernet
address, rather than IP address (like a router). Since forwarding is
done at Layer 2, all protocols can go transparently through a bridge.
The Linux bridge code implements a subset of the ANSI/IEEE 802.1d
standard.

.. note:: Spanning Tree Protocol is not enabled by default in VyOS.
   :ref:`stp` can be easily enabled if needed.

Configuration
#############

Address
-------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> address <address | dhcp |
   dhcpv6>

   Configure interface `<interface>` with one or more interface
   addresses.

   * **address** can be specified multiple times as IPv4 and/or IPv6
     address, e.g. 192.0.2.1/24 and/or 2001:db8::1/64
   * **dhcp** interface address is received by DHCP from a DHCP server
     on this segment.
   * **dhcpv6** interface address is received by DHCPv6 from a DHCPv6
     server on this segment.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces bridge br0 address 192.0.2.1/24
     set interfaces bridge br0 address 192.0.2.2/24
     set interfaces bridge br0 address 2001:db8::ffff/64
     set interfaces bridge br0 address 2001:db8:100::ffff/64


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> ipv6 address autoconf

   .. include:: common-ipv6-addr-autoconf.txt

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> ipv6 address eui64
   <prefix>

   :abbr:`EUI-64 (64-Bit Extended Unique Identifier)` as specified in
   :rfc:`4291` allows a host to assign iteslf a unique 64-Bit IPv6
   address.

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces bridge br0 ipv6 address eui64 2001:db8:beef::/64


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> aging <time>

   MAC address aging `<time`> in seconds (default: 300).


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> max-age <time>

   Bridge maximum aging `<time>` in seconds (default: 20).

   If a another bridge in the spanning tree does not send out a hello
   packet for a long period of time, it is assumed to be dead.


Link Administration
-------------------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> description <description>

   Assign given `<description>` to interface. Description will also be
   passed to SNMP monitoring systems.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> disable

   Disable given `<interface>`. It will be placed in administratively
   down (``A/D``) state.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> disable-flow-control

   Disable Ethernet flow control (pause frames).


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> mac <mac-address>

   Configure user defined :abbr:`MAC (Media Access Control)` address on
   given `<interface>`.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> igmp querier

   Enable IGMP querier



Member Interfaces
-----------------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> member interface <member>

   Assign `<member>` interface to bridge `<interface>`. A completion
   helper will help you with all allowed interfaces which can be
   bridged. This includes :ref:`ethernet-interface`,
   :ref:`bond-interface`, :ref:`l2tpv3-interface`, :ref:`openvpn`,
   :ref:`vxlan-interface`, :ref:`wireless-interface`,
   :ref:`tunnel-interface` and :ref:`geneve-interface`.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> member interface <member>
   priority <priority>

   Configure individual bridge port `<priority>`.

   Each bridge has a relative priority and cost. Each interface is
   associated with a port (number) in the STP code. Each has a priority
   and a cost, that is used to decide which is the shortest path to
   forward a packet. The lowest cost path is always used unless the
   other path is down. If you have multiple bridges and interfaces then
   you may need to adjust the priorities to achieve optimium
   performance.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> member interface <member>
   cost <cost>

   Path `<cost>` value for Spanning Tree Protocol. Each interface in a
   bridge could have a different speed and this value is used when
   deciding which link to use. Faster interfaces should have lower
   costs.


.. _stp:

STP Parameter
-------------

:abbr:`STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)` is a network protocol that builds a
loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of
STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results
from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup
links providing fault tolerance if an active link fails.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> stp

   Enable spanning tree protocol. STP is disabled by default.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> forwarding-delay <delay>

   Spanning Tree Protocol forwarding `<delay>` in seconds (default: 15).

   Forwarding delay time is the time spent in each of the Listening and
   Learning states before the Forwarding state is entered. This delay is
   so that when a new bridge comes onto a busy network it looks at some
   traffic before participating.


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bridge <interface> hello-time <interval>

   Spanning Tree Protocol hello advertisement `<interval>` in seconds
   (default: 2).

   Periodically, a hello packet is sent out by the Root Bridge and the
   Designated Bridges. Hello packets are used to communicate information
   about the topology throughout the entire Bridged Local Area Network.


Example
-------

Creating a bridge interface is very simple. In this example we will
have:

* A bridge named `br100`
* Member interfaces `eth1` and VLAN 10 on interface `eth2`
* Enable STP
* Bridge answers on IP address 192.0.2.1/24 and 2001:db8::ffff/64

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces bridge br100 address 192.0.2.1/24
  set interfaces bridge br100 address 2001:db8::ffff/64
  set interfaces bridge br100 member interface eth1
  set interfaces bridge br100 member interface eth2.10
  set interfaces bridge br100 stp

This results in the active configuration:

.. code-block:: none

   vyos@vyos# show interfaces bridge br100
    address 192.0.2.1/24
    address 2001:db8::ffff/64
    member {
        interface eth1 {
        }
        interface eth2.10 {
        }
    }
    stp
