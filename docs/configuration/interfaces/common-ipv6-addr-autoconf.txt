:abbr:`SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)`
:rfc:`4862`. IPv6 hosts can configure themselves automatically when connected
to an IPv6 network using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol via :abbr:`ICMPv6
(Internet Control Message Protocol version 6)` router discovery messages.
When first connected to a network, a host sends a link-local router
solicitation multicast request for its configuration parameters; routers
respond to such a request with a router advertisement packet that contains
Internet Layer configuration parameters.

.. note:: This method automatically disables IPv6 traffic forwarding on the
  interface in question.
