Dummy
#####

The dummy interface is really a little exotic, but rather useful nevertheless.
Dummy interfaces are much like the :ref:`loopback-interface` interface, except
you can have as many as you want.

.. note:: Dummy interfaces can be used as interfaces that always stay up (in
   the same fashion to loopbacks in Cisco IOS), or for testing purposes.

.. hint:: A Dummy interface is always up, thus it could be used for
   management traffic or as source/destination for and :abbr:`IGP (Interior
   Gateway Protocol)` like :ref:`bgp` so your internal BGP link is not dependent
   on physical link states and multiple routes can be chosen to the
   destination. A :ref:`dummy-interface` Interface should always be preferred
   over a :ref:`loopback-interface` interface.


Configuration
#############

Address
-------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces dummy <interface> address <address | dhcp | dhcpv6>

   Configure dummy interface `<interface>` with one or more interface
   addresses. Address can be specified multiple times as IPv4 and/or IPv6
   address, e.g. 192.0.2.1/24 and/or 2001:db8::1/64

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces dummy dum10 address 192.0.2.1/24
     set interfaces dummy dum10 address 192.0.2.2/24
     set interfaces dummy dum10 address 2001:db8::ffff/64
     set interfaces dummy dum10 address 2001:db8:100::ffff/64

Link Administration
-------------------

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces dummy <interface> description <description>

   Assign given `<description>` to interface. Description will also be passed
   to SNMP monitoring systems.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces dummy <interface> disable

   Disable given `<interface>`. It will be placed in administratively down
   state.

Operation
=========

.. opcmd:: show interfaces dummy

   Show brief interface information.information

   .. code-block:: none

     vyos@vyos:~$ show interfaces dummy
     Codes: S - State, L - Link, u - Up, D - Down, A - Admin Down
